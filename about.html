            <div> <!--Paragraph on one of the things I enjoy doing-->
                One of the things I enjoy the most is exploring new places with my daughter.
                I like to take her to different playgrounds or adventurous places every week. We have
               had the opportunity to go to Legoland California Resort, visit aquariums such as Sea Life, watch Disney on Ice,
               and so many more things! My goal is to give her many more adventures throughout her childhood!

            <div><!--Second paragraph on the things I enjoy doing -->
                Another thing I enjoy doing during my free time is going to the gym. I have been working out 
                since I was 16. I typically workout 4-5 times a week and like to lift heavy weights at the gym.
                I love the feeling of being sore and feeling at my best!
