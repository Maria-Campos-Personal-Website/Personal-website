    <div class = "portfolio-container">

        <!--first project-->
        <div> One of the projects I had the opportunity to complete at UTA was designing a relational database management system for a small hospital. 
        I defined entities, attributes, and relationships. I also drew out the relationship tables, defined keys, and I was eventually able
        to create statements to query my database with SQL.

        </div>

        <!--second project-->
        <div> Another small project I have worked on in the past has been connecting my Java application to MySQL library database in order to allow
        a user to enter additional information using menu options. This information can include an author's name, editing an author's name,
         or adding a new book title. 

            <!--second project-->
            <img src="Images/javaCode.jpeg" alt = "Snippet of the program code">
        </div>

        <!--Languages div-->
        <div class = "languages"> Languages I have learned: 
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
