    <h2> Here you will find some of the projects I have had the opportunity to work on. </h2>

    <!--First Project-->

    <div>
        One of the projects I had the opportunity to complete at UTA was designing a relational database management system for a small hospital. 
        I defined entities, attributes, and relationships. I also drew out the relationship tables, defined keys, and I was eventually able
        to create statements to query my database with SQL.
    </div>

    <div> Another small project I have worked on in the past has been connecting my Java application to MySQL database in order to allow
        a user to enter additional information into a library's database.
